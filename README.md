flamework-solr
--

Work in progress. Which means it all works but it needs documentation and
install/setup scripts, still.

Caveats
--

* Requires Solr 3.1 or higher.

* Currently wired to expect a single global Solr endpoint which makes working
  with multiple cores possible but a total pain in the ass.
